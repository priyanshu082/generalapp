                <h1>The Sun</h1>
                <p>"The sun is like a big, hot ball in the sky. It's very, very far away, but it gives us light and warmth
                    every day. The sun is so big that it helps plants grow and gives us light to see during the day. It's
                    like a giant star that shines brightly in the sky. We need the sun to live because it helps keep our
                    planet warm and helps plants make food through a process called photosynthesis. So, the sun is like a
                    big, glowing friend up in the sky!"</p>

                <p>"Mercury is like a small, rocky ball in space. It's the closest planet to the sun, so it's very, very hot during the day
                and very, very cold at night. It's so hot that if you were there, you could melt like an ice cream cone in the sun!
                Mercury doesn't have any air to breathe like we do on Earth, and it's covered with craters and rocks. It's the smallest
                planet in our solar system, but it's still really interesting to learn about! Scientists study Mercury to understand
                more about the planets and space."</p>

                making it the hottest planet in our solar system. Venus is sometimes called the "morning star" or the "evening star"
                because it's often the brightest object in the sky besides the moon. It doesn't have any moons of its own."</p>

                forests, and deserts. We have air to breathe, water to drink, and food to eat because of Earth. It's just the right
                distance from the sun, so it's not too hot or too cold. Earth is very special!"</p>

                Scientists think there might have been water on Mars long ago, which makes them wonder if there could have been life
                there too. Mars has two tiny moons named Phobos and Deimos."</p>
